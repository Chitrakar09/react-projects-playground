# React Projects Playground

A collection of beginner-to-intermediate React projects showcasing my practical understanding of core React concepts. This repository documents my hands-on learning path, covering everything from basic UI logic to state management, routing, API integration, and local persistence.

## 📘 About

The **React Projects Playground** is a portfolio of focused, self-contained React apps built as part of my ongoing journey in mastering modern front-end development. These mini-projects demonstrate my growth as a developer by applying React fundamentals in meaningful, functional ways.

Each project targets a specific concept or technique in React development, ranging from UI interaction and styling to context API, custom hooks, and Redux Toolkit.

## 🚀 Projects Overview

| Project Folder | Project Name            | Description |
|----------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **proj1/background_changer** | Background Changer         | A simple utility that updates background color using `useState` and basic event handling. |
| **proj2/password_generator** | Password Generator         | Dynamically generates secure passwords with character rules and React state logic. |
| **proj3/currency_converter** | Currency Converter         | A live converter using a public currency API with custom hooks for data fetching and modular logic separation. |
| **proj4/react-Router**       | React Router Demo          | Demonstrates navigation across multiple views using `react-router-dom`. |
| **proj5/theme_changer**      | Theme Changer (Dark/Light) | Implements theme toggling with **Context API**, managing global theme state across components. |
| **proj6/todoApp**            | To-Do App (Context)        | A functional to-do list using Context API and local storage for persistent task management. |
| **proj7/redux_todoapp**      | To-Do App (Redux Toolkit)  | Enhanced to-do list leveraging Redux Toolkit for structured, scalable state management with persistence. |

## 🧰 Key Features

- **React Core**: Functional components, props, hooks.
- **State Management**: `useState`, `useContext`, and Redux Toolkit (RTK).
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic (e.g., data fetching in currency converter).
- **Routing**: SPA navigation with `react-router-dom`.
- **Local Storage**: Persistent data storage in to-do apps.
- **Context API**: Applied in global state scenarios (e.g., theme toggling).
- **API Integration**: Real-time data consumption using public APIs.

## ⚙️ How to Run Projects

Each project is self-contained. To run a project:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chitrakar09/react-projects-playground.git
   ```

2. **Navigate into the project**
   ```bash
   cd react-projects-playground/proj3/currency_converter
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

> ⚠️ Note: Make sure you’re inside the correct project folder when running commands. Each project has its own dependencies and Vite setup.

## 🌱 Learning Focus

These projects help me strengthen:

- Modular and scalable component design
- One-way data flow and controlled components
- Global state handling with context and Redux
- API data fetching and abstraction through custom hooks
- Theme switching and routing logic

## 🔮 Future Plans

I plan to keep expanding this project base as I grow. Upcoming goals include:

- Creating a **separate repository for backend development**, exploring Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and REST APIs.
- Launching **dedicated repositories for advanced frontend projects**, including dashboards, full-stack apps, and TypeScript integration.
- Experimenting with advanced topics like:
  - Custom hook libraries
  - Form handling with validation
  - Unit testing and integration testing
